Encryption System:
  A Java-based encryption system designed to secure file transmission over public networks.

Background:
  The idea for this project was born during my Cyber Security internship, where I realized the importance of secure data transmission. This Encryption System is a    learning project that aims to provide a simple and effective way to encrypt and decrypt files.

Overview:
  The Encryption System takes an input file (currently supporting .txt and .java formats) and converts it into a non-readable cipher text format using a password     known only to the sender and receiver. The cipher text can be transmitted over public networks without risk of interception or unauthorized access.

Features: 
  GUI-based file selection: Easily select the original file and cipher text file using the graphical user interface.

Save and send cipher text: 
  Save the converted cipher text to your PC and send it to the receiver.

Password-based encryption: 
  Use any combination of password for encryption, but ensure the same password is used for decryption to avoid altering the content.

Secure transmission: 
  Transmit files securely over unsecure networks like public networks.

100% accuracy: 
  The original file and final decrypted file are identical.

Well-tested: 
  Thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and effectiveness.

Future Development:
  Support for additional file formats
  Enhanced security features
  Improved user interface

Usage:
  Select the original file using the GUI-based file selection facility.
  Enter the password for encryption.
  Save the converted cipher text to your PC.
  Send the cipher text to the receiver.
  At the receiver's end, use the same password to decrypt the cipher text.
